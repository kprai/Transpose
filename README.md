# AgGridPartial

This is a small Angular app used to demonstrate techniques for transposing rows and columns in [ag-grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/). This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.0.

You can run the app at [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/LMFinney/ag-grid-partial) or clone it and follow the steps below. The techniques and context are described in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BR9sH7zG7g) and [blog post](https://blog.oasisdigital.com/2018/transposing-rows-and-columns-in-ag-grid/).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
